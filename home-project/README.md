## Summary
This take home project uses data from the NY Times api to filter through daily articles, and allow a user to search certain articles by the articles 'section' tag. A user can also click on an article to take a look at a more detailed list of the article such as who wrote it, when it was published and a link to the article itself on the new york times page. A few things a discovered while doing this project include the localeCompare method on strings, which will find whatever string comes first using a numeric value and then display them in that order.

#Future Extensions 
I'd like to implement a search bar, to find an article by its name. Also, make it so the articles display in a much prettier form, and not just in one big line.
